  - **Total potential savings: $23,400/year**
- Flux pricing at $4,800/year = **20% value capture** (5:1 ROI for customer)
- This validates pricing sustainability

---

#### Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM)

**Realistic Constraints:**

**Geographic Focus (Phase 1-2):** U.S. + Canada only
- ~220,000 target restaurants × $4,800 = **$1.06B SAM**

**POS Integration Feasibility:**
- Top 5 POS providers (Toast, Square, Clover, Lightspeed, Revel) cover ~70% of independent FSRs
- Flux will prioritize these integrations
- SAM adjusted for POS coverage: $1.06B × 70% = **$740M SAM**

**Adoption Curve Reality:**
- Early adopters (innovators + early majority): ~25% of SAM over 5 years
- **Realistic 5-year SAM target:** $740M × 25% = **$185M**

---

#### Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM)

**3-Year Capture Estimate (Conservative):**

**Year 1:** Beachhead strategy
- 200 customers × $4,800 = $960K revenue (0.5% of SAM)

**Year 2:** Scale through POS partnerships
- 1,000 customers × $4,800 = $4.8M revenue (2.5% penetration of early SAM)

**Year 3:** Category establishment
- 3,500 customers × $4,800 = $16.8M revenue (9% of early SAM)

**3-Year SOM Target: $16.8M ARR** (0.9% of total SAM, 9% of early adopter segment)

**Market Share Assumptions:**
- Assumes 1-2 dominant competitors emerge in this category
- Flux captures 15-20% of the "predictive restaurant ops" category by Year 3
- Does not assume displacement of POS systems (complementary, not competitive)

---

### Stress Test Analysis: Market Assumption Validation

#### Critical Assumption: POS Provider Integration Cooperation

**Base Case Assumption:** Top 5 POS providers (covering 70% of market) will provide API access or cooperate with integrations.

**Stress Test Scenarios:**

**Scenario A: Limited POS Cooperation (Only 3 providers cooperate)**

**Reality Check:**
- Toast (market leader, ~25% share) has ecosystem strategy—likely to cooperate
- Square (~20% share) has open API for third-party apps—already accessible
- Lightspeed (~8% share) targets SMEs with app marketplace—cooperative
- **BUT:** Clover (First Data) and Revel may have closed ecosystems or require expensive partnerships

**Impact on SAM:**
- Accessible market: Toast (25%) + Square (20%) + Lightspeed (8%) = **53% of restaurants**
- Adjusted SAM: $1.06B × 53% = **$562M** (down from $740M)
- **Risk magnitude: 24% reduction in SAM**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Manual CSV ingestion pathway:** Build parser for standard POS export formats (reduces automation value but maintains functionality)
2. **Revenue-share partnerships:** Offer POS providers 10-15% of Flux revenue to incentivize cooperation
3. **White-label offering:** License Flux engine to POS providers who want to build this capability
4. **Customer-driven API access:** Leverage customer contracts that guarantee data portability

**Adjusted 3-Year SOM:** $12.6M ARR (down from $16.8M, but still viable)

---

**Scenario B: Competitive Response from POS Providers**

**Risk:** Toast or Square builds similar predictive features and bundles them into core offering

**Timeline Analysis:**
- Toast IPO'd in 2021, has capital and R&D resources
- Typical enterprise feature development: 18-24 months
- Toast's current analytics: Descriptive only (reports, not predictions)
- **Probable timeline: Q3 2026 earliest**

**Flux Advantages (Defensibility):**
1. **Head start:** 18-24 month lead time to establish brand and customer lock-in
2. **Cross-platform intelligence:** Flux learns from 1,000s of restaurants across multiple POS systems; Toast only learns from Toast customers
3. **Specialized AI/ML team:** POS companies are transaction processors first, analytics second
4. **Recipe explosion depth:** This is Flux's core IP—POS systems don't have recipe/ingredient databases

**Impact Assessment:**
- **Best case:** POS providers validate the category, making customer education easier
- **Base case:** Flux becomes "premium tier" for multi-location operators who need cross-platform insights
- **Worst case:** 40% of potential customers choose "good enough" bundled solution
  - Adjusted SAM: $740M × 60% = **$444M**
  - **Risk magnitude: 40% reduction**

**Mitigation:**
1. **Network effects:** Build industry benchmarking (anonymous data sharing across Flux customers creates unique value)
2. **Vertical specialization:** Focus on high-complexity cuisines (fine dining, multi-course tasting menus) where generic POS analytics fail
3. **Integration bundling:** Partner with suppliers (Sysco, US Foods) to automate procurement execution (POS providers won't do this)

---

**Scenario C: Customer Adoption Friction (Trust in AI recommendations)**

**Risk:** Restaurant operators don't trust algorithmic recommendations and revert to "gut feel" management

**Evidence of Risk:**
- Industry is traditionally low-tech and relationship-driven
- "If it ain't broke, don't fix it" mentality
- Fear of over/under-ordering based on "black box" predictions

**Stress Test:**
- **Base assumption:** 25% of target market adopts over 5 years
- **Pessimistic scenario:** Only 10% adopt (tech-forward early adopters only)
  - Adjusted 5-year SAM: $740M × 10% = **$74M**
  - **Risk magnitude: 60% reduction in addressable market**

**Reality Check Indicators:**
- **Analog comparison:** QuickBooks adoption in small business sector
  - Initial resistance (1990s): "I have an accountant"
  - Current penetration: ~80% of SMBs use accounting software
  - **Timeline:** 15 years to mainstream adoption
- **Key difference:** QuickBooks solved immediate pain (tax compliance); Flux solves gradual bleed (waste/inefficiency)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Hybrid mode:** Allow operators to review and approve all recommendations for first 90 days (training wheels approach)
2. **Proof-of-concept pricing:** Free first month with savings guarantee (pay only if you save $X)
3. **Peer validation:** Case studies from respected chefs/operators in each regional market
4. **Explainable AI:** Show exactly why system recommends X kg of salmon (not just "the algorithm says so")
5. **Insurance partnership:** Partner with food waste insurance provider to backstop recommendations

**Realistic Adoption Curve Adjustment:**
- Year 1-2: Only tech-forward operators (5% of market)
- Year 3-5: Early majority with proven ROI case studies (15% cumulative)
- Year 5-10: Mainstream adoption as category matures (40% cumulative)

**Implication:** Revenue targets may need 18-24 month delay, but TAM remains intact long-term

---

**Scenario D: Economic Downturn / Restaurant Industry Contraction**

**Risk:** Recession causes restaurant closures, reducing absolute number of target customers

**Historical Context:**
- 2008-2009 recession: ~10% of restaurants closed
- COVID-2020: ~17% permanent closures (extreme outlier)
- **Base case recession impact: 8-12% customer base reduction**

**Impact on TAM:**
- 200,000 target restaurants × 90% survival = 180,000 restaurants
- Adjusted TAM: **$864M** (down 10% from $960M)

**Counter-Intuitive Opportunity:**
- **Surviving restaurants are MORE cost-conscious during downturns**
- Flux's value proposition (waste reduction, labor optimization) becomes MORE valuable
- **Potential ARPU increase:** Desperate operators may pay premium for survival tools

**Historical Precedent:**
- SaaS companies often grow during recessions (37signals/Basecamp grew 2008-2009)
- Cost-saving tools outperform revenue-growth tools in downturns

**Adjusted Scenario:**
- **Pessimistic:** 10% fewer customers, but 20% higher willingness-to-pay
  - 180,000 customers × $5,760 ARPU = **$1.04B TAM** (actually HIGHER than base case)

---

**Stress Test Summary Matrix**

| Scenario | Impact on SAM | Likelihood | Mitigation Effectiveness | Residual Risk |
|----------|---------------|------------|--------------------------|---------------|
| **Limited POS cooperation (3 of 5)** | -24% ($562M) | **Medium (40%)** | High (CSV ingestion, rev-share) | **Low** |
| **POS competitive response** | -40% ($444M) | **High (70%)** | Medium (specialization, network effects) | **Medium** |
| **Low AI trust/adoption** | -60% ($74M 5yr) | **Medium (35%)** | High (hybrid mode, proof-of-concept) | **Medium** |
| **Economic downturn** | -10% to +8% | **Low (20%)** | N/A (macro factor) | **Low** |

---

**Revised Conservative Market Sizing (Stress-Tested)**

**Adjusted SAM (Assuming Scenario B + partial Scenario A):**
- Base SAM: $740M
- POS competition discount: -25% = $555M
- Slower adoption curve: 15% over 5 years (vs. 25%)
- **Conservative 5-year SAM: $83M** (vs. $185M optimistic)

**Revised 3-Year SOM (Conservative Case):**
- Year 3 target: $8-10M ARR (vs. $16.8M optimistic)
- Assumes slower initial traction but sustainable growth

**Key Insight:** Even under stress scenarios, market remains venture-scale ($80M+ SAM), but **time-to-scale extends 18-24 months**.

**Strategic Implications:**
1. **Prioritize customer trust-building** over rapid scaling (case studies > paid ads)
2. **Secure 2-3 POS partnerships early** before competitors lock up distribution
3. **Build defensible IP** (recipe database, cross-platform intelligence) that POS providers can't easily replicate
4. **Plan for 4-5 year path to scale** (not 2-3 years) to account for adoption curve

---

**Scenario E: Data Quality & Frequency Issues**

**Risk:** Poor data quality from restaurants undermines prediction accuracy, causing customer churn before ROI is realized.

**The Core Problem:**
Independent restaurants often have:
- Inconsistent transaction logging (manual voids, generic buttons, comped items not tracked)
- Incomplete recipe data (no digitized recipes)
- Manual workarounds that bypass POS
- Historical data gaps from system migrations
- Batch data exports (24-48 hour lag) instead of real-time

**Impact Analysis:**
- 20% transaction inaccuracy → Predictions accurate only ±15% instead of ±5%
- 50% incomplete recipes → Core inventory feature only half-functional
- 24-48 hour data lag → Labor recommendations always "looking backward"
- **Customer perception:** "The AI is just guessing" → churn before 6-month mark

**Mitigation Strategy: Zero-Burden Data Optimization**

**1. Data Health Score Algorithm (0-100%)**
```
Overall Score =
  40% × Completeness (transaction coverage, recipe coverage, historical depth) +
  30% × Consistency (pattern stability, void rate, categorization accuracy) +
  20% × Timeliness (data freshness, sync frequency) +
  10% × Accuracy (anomaly detection, reconciliation, external validation)
```

**2. Intelligent Prioritization ("Bang for Buck")**
- System calculates: `Priority = (Impact × Revenue Gain) / Operator Effort`
- Only asks operators to fix top 3 highest-impact issues per week
- Auto-fixes low-priority issues without bothering operator
- Example: Missing salmon recipe (5 min fix, $200/mo impact) prioritized over missing appetizer recipes (15 min fix, $30/mo impact)

**3. Minimal-Friction Data Collection**

**"5-Minute Mondays":** Weekly micro-tasks (time-boxed, optional, gamified)
```
☕ Good morning! 5-minute data check:
1. Your "Grilled Salmon" needs a recipe - [Use our template] [Custom] [Skip]
2. 12 voided transactions Friday - [Normal] [POS glitch] [Not sure]
That's it! This improves predictions by 15%.
```

**"Smart Defaults" with One-Click Confirmation:**
- System suggests standard recipes from 10,000+ library
- Operator confirms in 5 seconds vs. 20 minutes manual entry
- 80% accuracy achieved with zero data entry

**"Passive Data Collection":**
- Invoice OCR: Scan supplier invoices → reverse-engineer recipes
- Photo upload: Take picture of handwritten recipe card → AI extracts data
- Pattern learning: System infers relationships from POS behavior (no operator input)

**"Progressive Enhancement":**
- Week 1: Basic forecasting (±25% accuracy) with zero setup
- Week 2-4: Smart defaults (±15% accuracy) with 10 minutes operator time
- Month 2-3: Refinements (±8% accuracy) as operator corrects edge cases
- Month 4+: Full optimization (±5% accuracy) with minimal ongoing maintenance

**4. Just-in-Time Micro-Training**
- No 45-minute training videos (operators won't watch)
- Contextual tips appear when issues detected: "We noticed high void rate Friday - were these legitimate? [Yes/No]"
- Optional staff training cards (printable PDFs): "5 POS Habits That Help Flux"
- Weekly digest email (3-minute read) with one actionable tip

**5. Automation-First Philosophy**
- Outlier detection & removal (automatic)
- Missing data imputation using historical patterns (automatic)
- Category auto-classification using NLP (one-click confirmation)
- Intelligent reconciliation across POS, invoices, reservations (automatic)

**Revised Risk Assessment:**

| Mitigation Strategy | Risk Reduction | Implementation Cost | Time to Value |
|---------------------|----------------|---------------------|---------------|
| Intelligent data validation | -40% | Medium (6 months) | Immediate |
| Hybrid human-AI workflow | -50% | Low (UX changes) | Immediate |
| Multi-source data fusion | -30% | High (12 months) | 6-12 months |
| Probabilistic forecasting | -20% | Medium (3 months) | 3 months |
| Incentivize data hygiene | -25% | Low (training materials) | Ongoing |
| Proprietary recipe database | -60% | High (12-18 months) | 6 months |

**Combined Effect:** Data quality risk reduced by 70-80%

**Time Investment vs. Value:**
- **Zero effort** (POS only): 60% data quality, ±25% accuracy, 0 min
- **Minimal effort** (5-min Mondays): 75% data quality, ±15% accuracy, 20 min/month
- **Light effort** (photos/invoices): 85% data quality, ±8% accuracy, 1 hour one-time
- **Engaged** (refinements): 95% data quality, ±5% accuracy, 5 min/week

**Key Insight:** Even at "Minimal" effort (20 min/month), operator gets 80% of value—the sweet spot for time-strapped restaurateurs.

**Strategic Implications:**
1. **Product positioning:** Market as "Zero-setup restaurant intelligence" vs. competitors requiring weeks of data entry
2. **Beachhead strategy:** Target tech-forward restaurants first (already have clean data)
3. **White-glove onboarding:** First 100 customers get dedicated data analyst for 90 days
4. **Competitive advantage:** "Works despite messy data" becomes differentiator—most competitors assume clean data exists
5. **Tiered pricing:** Basic tier (75% accuracy), Premium (90% accuracy), Enterprise (95% accuracy with dedicated analyst)

**Impact on Flux:**
- **Positive:** Market education accelerating; customers understand "AI predictions" concept
- **Window of opportunity:** 3-5 years before tools become fully commoditized
- **Strategic imperative:** Build proprietary data moats (recipe databases, cross-platform learning) that generic AI platforms cannot replicate

---

**Trend 2: Labor Crisis & Operational Efficiency Focus (2021-Present)**

**Description:**
Post-COVID labor shortages have forced restaurants to optimize existing staff rather than hire more. Industry-wide focus on "doing more with less."

**Evidence:**
- U.S. restaurant industry unemployment at historic lows (~3.2% in 2024)
- Average hourly wages increased 25% (2019-2024), compressing margins
- 78% of operators report staffing as top operational challenge (NRA 2024 State of the Industry)

**Impact on Flux:**
- **Positive:** Labor scheduling optimization feature has immediate, urgent value
- **Positioning:** Flux is not about "replacing workers" (politically sensitive) but "empowering managers to schedule smarter"
- **ROI case:** Even 5% labor efficiency gain = $24K annual savings for average restaurant

---

**Trend 3: Sustainability & Food Waste Awareness (2020-2030)**

**Description:**
Growing regulatory pressure (California SB 1383 mandates 75% organic waste reduction by 2025) and consumer preference for sustainable restaurants driving waste reduction initiatives.

**Drivers:**
- ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) reporting requirements expanding to mid-size businesses
- Gen Z/Millennial diners prioritizing sustainability (62% willing to pay premium for sustainable restaurants)
- Rising landfill costs and waste disposal regulations

**Impact on Flux:**
- **Positive:** Waste reduction is becoming a compliance issue, not just a "nice to have"
- **Marketing angle:** "Flux helps you meet CA SB 1383 compliance while saving money"
- **Data monetization:** Aggregated waste data could be valuable to regulators, sustainability consultants, or food suppliers

---

**Trend 4: POS System Consolidation & Ecosystem Lock-In (2018-2025)**

**Description:**
Top 3 POS providers (Toast, Square, Clover) now control ~55% of independent restaurant market. These platforms are building "walled garden" ecosystems with integrated payroll, inventory, and analytics.

**Evidence:**
- Toast's ecosystem strategy: adding Capital (lending), Payroll, Marketing tools
- Square acquired Weebly (websites), Afterpay (payments) to expand beyond POS
- App marketplaces growing (Toast has 200+ third-party integrations)

**Impact on Flux:**
- **Risk:** POS providers may view advanced analytics as strategic and refuse integrations
- **Opportunity:** Becoming a "must-have" third-party app in Toast/Square marketplaces creates distribution channel
- **Hybrid strategy:** Build both B2B (direct to restaurants) and B2B2B (white-label to POS providers) offerings

---

**Trend 5: Data Privacy & AI Regulation (2024-2028)**

**Description:**
Increasing scrutiny of AI systems, particularly around bias in algorithmic decision-making and data ownership rights.

**Regulatory Developments:**
- EU AI Act (2024): High-risk AI systems require transparency and explainability
- California CPRA (2023): Expanded data privacy rights for consumers
- Federal AI legislation likely by 2026 (bipartisan support)

**Impact on Flux:**
- **Compliance requirement:** Must build "explainable AI" (show why recommendations are made)
- **Competitive advantage:** Early investment in transparency = trust with privacy-conscious operators
- **Data strategy:** Clear data ownership (restaurants own their data, Flux processes it) to avoid regulatory risk

---

#### Growth Drivers

**Primary Growth Drivers:**

1. **Economic Pressure:** Rising food and labor costs (30-35% of revenue each) create urgent need for optimization tools. Every 1% efficiency gain = $15K-$30K annual savings for target segment.

2. **Technology Maturity:** POS systems have achieved near-universal adoption (~95% of restaurants), creating clean data infrastructure that Flux can plug into. APIs are standardizing.

3. **Generational Shift:** Younger restaurant owners (Millennials inheriting family businesses, Gen Z entrepreneurs) are more tech-native and willing to adopt AI-driven tools.

4. **Supply Chain Volatility:** COVID-exposed fragility of restaurant supply chains. Operators now see value in predictive procurement to avoid stockouts/overstocking.

5. **Capital Availability:** Despite broader tech downturn, restaurant tech remains VC-attractive (Toast's $5B IPO validated category). Funding available for proven solutions.

---

#### Market Inhibitors

**Factors Constraining Market Growth:**

1. **Thin Margins, Risk Aversion:** Average restaurant net profit margin = 3-5%. Operators hesitant to spend on software unless ROI is guaranteed and immediate.

2. **Technological Literacy Gap:** Many restaurant owners lack formal business/tech training. "Black box" AI systems face skepticism. Must invest heavily in education and support.

3. **High Churn Industry:** ~60% of restaurants fail within 3 years. Customer acquisition cost may not be recovered if customer closes within 12-18 months.

4. **Data Quality Issues:** Many restaurants have inconsistent POS usage (servers manually voiding transactions, not logging comps properly). "Garbage in, garbage out" problem for AI models. (Addressed via Scenario E mitigation strategies above)

5. **Integration Complexity:** Even with APIs, custom integrations for recipe data, supplier catalogs, and payroll systems require significant engineering effort per customer.

### Jobs-to-be-Done Analysis

#### Functional Jobs

**Core Tasks Restaurant Operators Need to Accomplish:**

1. **Predict demand to avoid waste and stockouts**
   - "When I'm placing my weekly order, I need to know how much of each ingredient I'll actually use, so I don't overorder (waste) or underorder (lose sales)."
   - Current workaround: Eyeball last week's invoices, add safety margin

2. **Schedule staff efficiently**
   - "When creating next week's schedule, I need to match labor hours to expected customer traffic, so I don't blow my labor budget or deliver poor service."
   - Current workaround: Copy last week's schedule with minor tweaks

3. **Make data-driven purchasing decisions**
   - "When supplier prices fluctuate, I need to know if I should switch ingredients or adjust menu prices, so I maintain my target food cost percentage."
   - Current workaround: Negotiate with suppliers reactively, absorb cost increases

4. **Identify unprofitable menu items**
   - "When analyzing my menu, I need to understand true profitability (not just COGS), so I can promote winners and fix/remove losers."
   - Current workaround: Gut feel based on perceived popularity

5. **Reduce time on manual admin tasks**
   - "When managing inventory, I need automation for counting, ordering, and reconciliation, so I can spend time on customer experience instead."
   - Current workaround: Manual spreadsheets, 10-15 hours/week of administrative work

#### Emotional Jobs

**Feelings and States Restaurant Operators Seek:**

1. **Confidence in decision-making**

### Customer Journey Mapping

**For Primary Customer Segment: Independent Full-Service Restaurant Owner (1-2 locations, €500K revenue)**

**1. Awareness: How do they discover Flux?**

- **Trigger:** Frustration after another week of overordering (seeing €200 worth of spoiled produce) OR receiving a surprisingly high labor cost report from accountant
- **Discovery channels:**
  - **POS marketplace:** Browsing Toast/Lightspeed/Square app stores for "analytics" or "inventory" tools
  - **Peer recommendation:** Hears about Flux from another restaurant owner at local industry meetup or WhatsApp group
  - **Content marketing:** Finds blog post or YouTube video "How to reduce food waste by 30%" ranking in Google search
  - **Industry media:** Sees case study in restaurant trade publication (e.g., *Hostelería & Turismo*, *BigHospitality*)
  - **Social media:** Sees LinkedIn/Instagram post from restaurant tech influencer or chef using the tool

- **Initial perception:** "Another analytics tool that probably won't work with my messy data... but if it actually saves me €1,000/month, it's worth investigating."

---

**2. Consideration: How do they evaluate Flux?**

- **Evaluation criteria (in priority order):**
  1. **Proven ROI:** Case studies showing €500-€2,000/month savings for similar restaurants
  2. **POS compatibility:** "Does it work with my Lightspeed/Toast/Square system without manual data entry?"
  3. **Setup time:** "Will this take 10 hours to configure or 10 minutes?"
  4. **Ease of use:** "Can I understand this without hiring a data analyst?"
  5. **Trial period:** "Can I test it for 30 days without commitment?"
  6. **Support:** "If something goes wrong, can I talk to a human in Spanish/English?"

- **Evaluation process:**
  - **Week 1:** Visits website, watches 3-minute demo video, reads 2-3 case studies
  - **Week 2:** Signs up for free trial (or requests demo if not self-serve)
  - **Week 3-4:** Connects POS, explores dashboards, reviews first recommendations (but doesn't act on them yet)
  - **Week 5-6:** Tests 1-2 recommendations (e.g., reduces order quantity for ingredient with low forecast), tracks results
  - **Week 7:** Decides based on whether recommendations were accurate and whether they saw tangible savings

- **Common objections:**
  - "My data is too messy for this to work." (Mitigated by: Data Health Score, "works despite messy data" positioning)
  - "I don't trust AI to make decisions about my business." (Mitigated by: Hybrid mode, explainable recommendations)
  - "I can't afford another monthly subscription." (Mitigated by: ROI calculator, savings guarantee)
  - "My current system works fine." (Mitigated by: Quantified waste/inefficiency assessment, free trial)

---

**3. Purchase: What triggers the buying decision?**

- **Decision triggers:**
  - **Positive trial experience:** Flux correctly predicted demand surge for weekend, operator avoided stockout
  - **Tangible savings:** Operator sees €300-€500 reduction in waste during trial month
  - **Peer validation:** Another restaurateur in owner's network vouches for tool
  - **Seasonal timing:** Beginning of new quarter or after accountant review meeting highlighting inefficiencies
  - **Regulatory pressure:** New waste reporting requirements make tracking imperative

- **Purchase process:**
  - **Self-serve:** Clicks "Upgrade to Paid Plan" button in app, enters payment details (Stripe checkout), immediate activation
  - **Sales-assisted:** Books call with account manager to discuss multi-location pricing or custom integrations
  - **Contract:** Monthly subscription (preferred) or annual with discount

- **Pricing decision:**
  - Chooses €99/month tier (mid-tier) vs. €79 basic or €149 premium based on:
    - Number of ingredients tracked (300 vs. 500 vs. unlimited)
    - Forecast accuracy guarantee (±15% vs. ±10% vs. ±5%)
    - Support level (email vs. chat vs. phone)

---

**4. Onboarding: What happens in first 30 days?**

- **Immediate expectations (Day 1):**
  - "I want to see my POS data syncing and basic dashboards populating within 24 hours."
  - "I need a clear checklist of what to do next (not overwhelming 20-step process)."

- **Week 1: Data Foundation**
  - POS connection established (one-click OAuth)
  - Historical sales data ingested (last 6-12 months)
  - Ingredient list auto-generated from POS transaction categories
  - System prompts: "5-Minute Setup: Confirm your top 20 ingredients [Smart defaults populated]"

- **Week 2: First Insights**
  - Demand forecast dashboard available (even at ±20% accuracy with imperfect data)
  - System identifies "Quick Wins": "You overordered tomatoes by 30% last month—here's why and how to fix it."
  - First procurement recommendation delivered: "Order 12kg salmon this week (not your usual 15kg)"

- **Week 3: Trust Building**
  - Operator follows 2-3 recommendations, tracks outcomes
  - System provides explainability: "We recommended 12kg salmon because (1) last 3 Thursdays averaged 2.1kg sales, (2) holiday Monday reduces weekend traffic -15%, (3) weather forecast shows rain (correlates with -8% seafood orders)"
  - If predictions accurate → trust increases; if inaccurate → system explains why and asks for data correction

- **Week 4: Habit Formation**
  - Operator begins checking Flux dashboard Monday mornings before placing orders (new habit)
  - "5-Minute Mondays" micro-tasks appear: "Confirm recipe for 'Salmon Teriyaki' [Use template] [Custom]"
  - First "savings report" generated: "You saved €420 this month by reducing overordering and optimizing labor."

- **Onboarding success metric:** Operator acts on 3+ recommendations in first 30 days and achieves €300+ measurable savings.

- **Weekly cadence (Primary use case):**
  - **Monday morning (15 minutes):** Review demand forecast for upcoming week, generate procurement recommendations, send orders to suppliers
  - **Wednesday afternoon (5 minutes):** Adjust labor schedule for weekend based on updated reservations and weather data
  - **Friday morning (2 minutes):** Check inventory alerts for expiring ingredients, review dynamic pricing suggestions

- **Monthly cadence (Secondary use case):**
  - **End of month (30 minutes):** Review profitability dashboard, analyze menu item performance, identify pricing optimization opportunities
  - **5-Minute Mondays (5 minutes):** Complete data hygiene micro-tasks (confirm recipes, validate anomalies)

---

**6. Advocacy: What drives referrals and retention?**

- **Referral triggers:**
  - **Tangible ROI:** "I saved €1,200 last month—you should try this" (word-of-mouth at industry events)
  - **Solving pain point:** "Finally, a tool that works despite my messy POS data" (online reviews, social media)
  - **Social proof:** Operator shares savings screenshot on Instagram or LinkedIn
  - **Referral incentive:** Flux offers €50 credit for each successful referral

- **Retention drivers:**
  - **Habitual dependency:** Tool becomes part of weekly routine (high switching cost)
  - **Continuous value:** Savings compound over time as system learns restaurant's patterns
  - **Sunk data:** 6+ months of operational history locked in platform (switching means starting over)
  - **Network effects:** If Flux adds cross-restaurant benchmarking ("Your food cost is 4% higher than similar restaurants—here's why"), staying in network is valuable

- **Churn risks:**
  - **Inaccurate predictions:** If forecasts are consistently off, operator loses trust (mitigated by explainability and continuous learning)
  - **Lack of ROI visibility:** Operator doesn't track savings, forgets value (mitigated by monthly savings reports)
  - **Competitor offer:** POS provider bundles similar feature for free (mitigated by superior accuracy and cross-platform intelligence)
  - **Business closure:** Restaurant closes (industry churn, not product issue)

- **Expansion revenue opportunities:**
  - Upgrade from €99 to €149 tier after adding second location
  - Add premium support package for multi-location groups
  - Purchase optional modules (e.g., supplier marketplace integration, financial benchmarking)
